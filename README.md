**Abstract**: The current times are full of uncertainty. Economists and politicians are in search of information to show how the economy will develop in the future. Business and Consumer Surveys are one of the examples of the leading indicators. In this paper, we will present the main findings of the survey on survey in the industry sector in the Czech Republic. Thanks to the collected answers, we can (i) better understand the behaviour of our respondents and (ii) modify the future methodology. Thanks to these changes, respondents will find the definitions of the economic terms or a recommendation of "significant change" for the evaluation of the questions. These proposed changes improve the quality of analysis which are focused on the business cycle and the economy, respectively.
